# Incident Detection and Response (IDR)

## Objective
Develop and implement incident detection and response procedures by leveraging advanced tools, technologies, and methodologies to protect networks from potential threats.

---

## Skills Learned
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Configured and utilized IDS tools to monitor and identify suspicious network activity.
- **Packet Capture and Analysis:** Performed detailed packet-level analysis to investigate and confirm potential incidents.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Analyzed and correlated events using SIEM tools to identify threats and automate responses.
- **Incident Response Planning:** Developed incident response plans, including response and recovery strategies.
- **Forensic Investigation:** Conducted systematic investigations to preserve evidence and uncover root causes.
- **Post-Incident Actions:** Documented findings, recommended mitigation strategies, and implemented preventive measures.

## Tools Used
- **Python:** Automated log analysis, packet capture, and data parsing.
- **Linux:** Conducted forensic analysis and security configurations.
- **SQL:** Queried security logs and databases for in-depth incident analysis.
- **SIEM Tools:** Used platforms like Splunk and Google Chronicle to detect, investigate, and respond to incidents.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Configured and tested Snort IDS for real-time traffic monitoring and alerting.

## Project Details

### 1. Intrusion Detection and Response Implementation
- Configured Snort IDS to monitor and detect ICMP traffic, Telnet connections, and other anomalies.
- Created custom rules to identify specific attack patterns, such as brute-force attempts and port scanning.
- Tested IDS configuration using simulated attacks and validated rule effectiveness by analyzing real-time alerts.

### 2. Forensic Packet Capture and Analysis
- Captured and analyzed network traffic using tools like Wireshark.
- Investigated incidents by extracting relevant information, such as source IP, destination IP, and payload details, to identify malicious activity.
- Preserved forensic evidence following chain-of-custody best practices.

### 3. SIEM-Based Threat Detection
- Deployed and configured SIEM tools to aggregate and correlate security events from multiple sources, including firewalls, servers, and endpoints.
- Designed custom dashboards and alerts to visualize threat patterns, monitor network health, and detect suspicious behavior.
- Investigated multi-stage attacks using event correlation and identified the root cause.

### 4. Incident Response and Recovery
- Developed an incident response playbook that includes identification, containment, eradication, and recovery phases.
- Conducted tabletop exercises to simulate and refine response plans.
- Documented incident timelines and created post-incident reports with recommendations for improving security controls.

### 5. Post-Incident Documentation and Preventive Measures
- Wrote detailed post-incident reports highlighting lessons learned, vulnerabilities exploited, and mitigation steps taken.
- Implemented security enhancements such as stronger access controls, network segmentation, and improved logging configurations to reduce future risks.

## Impact
- Improved incident detection and response capabilities, reducing response time and minimizing potential damage.
- Enhanced network visibility through the integration of IDS and SIEM tools.
- Established a repeatable framework for responding to and recovering from security incidents.
- Developed comprehensive documentation to support ongoing security improvements and audit readiness.
